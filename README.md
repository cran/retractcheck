[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/libscie/retractcheck.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/libscie/retractcheck)

Check DOIs in a paper for being retracted by running your manuscript through `retractcheck` in R or using the [Shiny app](https://frederikaust.shinyapps.io/retractcheck_shinyapp/) in your browser. This R package builds on the API of [Open retractions](http://openretractions.com) ([also an open source project](https://github.com/fathomlabs/open-retractions)). 

The original inspiration for this package can be found [in a tweet by @PaolaPalma](https://twitter.com/PaoloAPalma/status/976545221268815872) and the origin of the name in [this tweet by @MarkHoffarth](https://twitter.com/MarkHoffarth/status/976548240672870405) :fire: 

Retracted papers :books: keep getting cited (see for example [here](https://osf.io/cszpy)) and this package aims to help reduce this effect. [Zotero provides](https://www.zotero.org/blog/retracted-item-notifications/) retraction checking *into* your reference manager, so be sure to check that out too :+1:

## Installation

```R
install.packages('retractcheck')
```

Please note that the dependency on `textreadr` may fail if you don't have the necessary software for that. If installation fails, try `install.packages('textreadr')` and see what errors it gives. It may look like this

```R
Configuration failed because poppler-cpp was not found. Try installing:
 * deb: libpoppler-cpp-dev (Debian, Ubuntu, etc)
 * On Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 use this PPA:
    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:opencpu/poppler
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo sudo apt-get install -y libpoppler-cpp-dev
 * rpm: poppler-cpp-devel (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL)
 * csw: poppler_dev (Solaris)
 * brew: poppler (Mac OSX)
```

## Limitations

If the `retractcheck` package does not return any hits for retracted references, please note that the result is only as good as the data made available on this.
